# TODO: Implement Role Switching for Dean and Teacher

- [x] Keep switch role button visible in both dean and teacher sidebars
- [x] Ensure switch role works for deans to switch to teacher and back
- [x] Teachers should not be able to switch roles (only deans can) - handled by controller logic
- [x] Admins can manage role switching but not switch themselves
- [x] Created test teacher accounts with matching usernames for dean accounts
- [x] Test the role switching functionality
